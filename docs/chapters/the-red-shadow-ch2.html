    <p>
    Even though I was stubborn, I wasn't energetic. I was the weak kind. Things related to going to shamba, digging and doing all that, I wasn't able to do. I knew how to hold a jembe firmly, but the energy that I was to use wasn’t there; it wasn’t nowhere within me. That made me flee from home because my mom had given me punishment of digging a whole acre of land. Failure to which, I was not to be seen. African parents! I therefore, opted for a simple way: running away with no mind of coming back, which seemed pretty cool for me.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my mom wasn't worried about me. I had disrespected her and that built a sort of animosity. She never wanted to beat me and she never did. She always said, "choose your path and do whatever you want." I had fled to one of my friend's home, Mutinda. He was my old friend and my former schoolmate. Mutinda had helped during a sport's day when some huge guy wanted to beat me. From that day we become close friends.</p>

<p>Mutinda’s home was some distance from ours. A two-minute walk where you’d borrow salt in case yours run out. But Mutinda’s never lend any one salt. They were always on their own—a pretending to be royal family. A family that’d see a fancy dress and take one year paying for it in installments. By the end of that payment, you’d have grown that the cloth didn't fit you well. That’s what they were. A royal but not royal family.</p>

<p>I was now standing at Mutinda’s door hoping he’d hear my footsteps and open up. His mother never liked me; she always said that I was a disgrace to her son. She thought I could even poison her son. What she didn't know was that I wasn't a killer; I couldn't poison my friend. Not once nor twice, she’d chased me from her compound. An impossible woman! But now I was at her place again, trying to find refuge. I called for Mutinda to open up. He couldn't hear me. Fuck! I could hear his mother opening her door. Her house was some few meters from his son's simba. I was starting to freak out. If this woman finds me here, I'm dead—I mean dead. She can even report me to the chief claiming that I stalked her while she was bathing. This was how impossible that woman was.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mutinda’s home was situated in a plain devoid of any trees or bushes to provide cover. The only available hiding spot was behind a less-than-ideal wall. I saw her and dashed for the wall. She was coming directly towards me. Her dog followed her. I feared dogs. Sweat started to drop off my face. Fuuuuuuuuccccck! Before she could reach me, I heard her voice: "what are you doing there?" she roared. I almost answered with freak. She repeated her words with much more intensity. I was now sweating, seriously sweating. I'm caught. Today I'll be at the chief's baraza for a crime I didn't commit. Fuuuuuuuuccccckk! I was going to be charged for dishonoring an impossible woman. I was going to be reported for entering her bedroom without her consent. Fuuuck. Ooh no, I thought.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, she was calling her son who slept till that late. 6:30 am was late for that woman. She banged Mutinda’s door with fury. Ooh poor Mutinda. Meanwhile, I was still hiding behind a wall watching scenes unfolding like a movie. Thanks to their dog who was too hungry to notice me. I am safe, for now, I said to myself. I survived.</p>

<p>Mutinda didn't notice me yet. For how long was I going to stand behind a wall which wasn't mine? For how long was I going to hide in a home which wasn't ours? I’d fucked up. How was I going to talk to Mutinda when her mother had already ruined my plan? I sat on the verandah where I was hiding. Out of blue, memories of Lavender and Jennifer hit me so hard like a hammer. Were they thinking of me? It has been two months without seeing the latter. My feelings were surely starting to fade off. I was neither happy nor sad; I just wanted refuge.</p>

<p>An hour passed and I was still hiding away from that woman. All I was able to do was shifting my sitting point. From verandah to ground to verandah again... I did that for a while and I was bored already. I therefore, made my mind. I was going to greet Mutinda’s mother and then talk to Mutinda. I was really daring. "What if this woman chases me with a machete?" I asked myself. Back home I knew what my mom was thinking. She was planning to get me home. Lure me with some few parental talks and then... I wasn't going to have my teeth again. I couldn't dare walk home. She was fuming...</p>

<p>As I had planned, I walked to face the impossible possibility. I had all the reasons to do it. "If you don't do it now, you'll add problems for yourself," I convinced myself. I dusted myself off. Gasped some air. Took a deep breath and then wheeled towards Suzzy, Mutinda’s mother. She saw me and I knew she saw a devil's incarnate. A ghost arising from the sea. She knew and I knew that we never liked each other. Why did she hate me so much? I matched, but before I could greet her, she folded her nose. Ooh no. My greeting wasn't answered. It didn't bother me in any way. Mutinda couldn't come off her mother's feet. He was being lectured. He slept till late. He had not washed utensils the previous day. He had not... Poor Mutinda was in trouble as I was.</p>

<p>My stomach was starting to rumble. I was starving. I hoped to get some tea from Mutinda. But it never came. My mind first ran home. I wasn't missing home; I was just hungry. I imagined drinking tea at that moment, cracking some jokes with mum. But it was all a fantasy. I could hear the intensity of Suzzy's voice; she was sizzling. Mutinda had made her angrier. My source of refuge was sending me to another refuge. But to where? Mutinda was the only friend I trusted even though her mother didn't like me.</p>

<p>Time passed and finally: "Move out of this house if you think you are big enough for the home chores." Suzzy’s voice was final and Mutinda couldn't say anything beyond. He was shocked. Our parents were really petty. What they weren't aware of is that we were never threatened by their words. Why would we be, yet if you talk while they are talking, that’s being disrespectful. If you listen to hear them complain, they'll still say you are disrespectful. Solution out was to leave home, until they were calm again. And that’s what rung in Mutinda’s mind, I knew. For the two hours I’ve been at Suzzy’s, I haven't changed a word with Mutinda. We saw each other, but never talked. Suzzy caused all these!</p>
