      Sofia raised herself and sat on the edge of the bed. She watched Hope, who lay deep asleep, and wondered how one could sleep so peacefully with impurity around them. Her mind drifted, and she remembered what her mother once taught her about purity—about partners and sex.
    </p>
    <p>There’s something called a soul, my daughter,” her mother’s voice echoed in her head. “That soul is linked to one man, whom we call a soulmate. Sleeping with multiple men destroys that soul, rendering it useless and impure… and one will never see heaven.”</p>

<p>The voice lingered and disturbed her for a moment. She ignored the rest of it.</p>

<p>She did not want to wake Hope. She stealthily tiptoed from the bed to the door, opened it slightly, then tiptoed back.</p>

“What are you doing?” Hope asked, rubbing her eyes with the back of her palm.<br>

“Didn’t want to wake you,” Sofia said in a shrilly whisper.<br>

“Well, another day, another struggle, right?”<br>
    Sofia chuckled softly. “What time does your father open the drinks store?”<br>

“You mean Adira?”<br>

“Will calling him father kill you?”<br>

“Yes!” She paused. “The shop is always open.”<br>

“Okay. I wish I had my father,” Sofia said sadly.<br>

“We always wish for things… that eventually—anyway, the shop is open.”<br>

“You know there’s only one word I said less than any other kid at school,” Sofia said as she reached for the bowl under the bed.<br>

“What’s that?”<br>

“Father. Other kids used to say it… my father bought me this, my father said that… I never got to do or say any of those. Because life happened.”<br>
