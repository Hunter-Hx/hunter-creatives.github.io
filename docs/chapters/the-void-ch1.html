  The dead are not counted all at once; they arrive slowly, one memory at a time.
</p>

      Inside a dark room, on an extremely cold day, a young girl rose from her neatly, yet rusty torn rags she called bed. She exhaustedly and blindly threw her left hand on the left drawer to find a match stick. The candle turb had previously burned down the rusted metallic candleholder. The candlelight flickered and brightly lit the room, revealing everything she owned. Everything. 
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      Seated on the edge of her bed, she slumped her head inside her hands that shakily trembled on her thighs. A minute past, she then pushed herself backwards and fell on the bed again; hands clamped on the back of her head. She blankly stared at the roof and unknowingly found herself counting the holes on the roof of her tiny room. 15 holes in total. One of her hands unclamped and wandered freely on the bed, her legs rhythmically tapping on the dusty flour.

     <p class="para">
      She hadn’t eaten the previous night but that didn’t make her weak. Poverty crushed her and her mind was in ruins. 
    </p>
     <p class="para">
     Dust rose from the floor and rolled up on the light that lit the room. Her mind shifted and drifted. She shook her head; disappointment planted on her face. She found herself counting the holes again. 18 holes she counted this time. A minute passed gain. 
    </p>
<p class="para">
      On her consciously unconscious mind, she got up and heard retreating footsteps- like a high-heeled lady walking down a staircase. As was her habit, she scanned her room. A burning sensation run through her heart and she felt hatred and rage. She despised herself for how all had been. With her eyes stuck on one photo on the wall, and the only photo her cracked wall, a reflection of a white paper slipped under her door. She ignored it, her mind fully into the photo. 
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     It was a photo of her last day at the university. The graduation regalia had suited her so splendidly. As long as she could remember, it was the last day she smiled genuinely, and that was two years ago. She walked a step closer to the photo, even though it was already as close as it could be. She observed and touched it with enthusiasm, with a feeling that touched her heart; a reminiscence of good old days but that faded just as quickly as it came. 
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      Her mind still far away from the white paper that patiently waited on the floor, she walked back to her bed and threw herself and clamped her hands like she previously did. She took a deep breath and then rolled her eyes on her room again. The same old feeling crept in. Hatred. Rage. Death
