  The dead are not counted all at once; they arrive slowly, one memory at a time.
</p>

    <p>
    
<p>Inside a dark room, on an extremely cold day, a young girl rose from her neatly, yet rusty torn rags she called bed. She exhaustedly and blindly threw her left hand on the left drawer to find a match stick. The candle turb had previously burned down the rusted metallic candleholder. The candlelight flickered and brightly lit the room, revealing everything she owned. Everything.</p>   
<p>Seated on the edge of her bed, she slumped her head inside her hands that shakily trembled on her thighs. A minute past, she then pushed herself backwards and fell on the bed again; hands clamped on the back of her head. She blankly stared at the roof and unknowingly found herself counting the holes on the roof of her tiny room. 15 holes in total. One of her hands unclamped and wandered freely on the bed, her legs rhythmically tapping on the dusty flour.</p> 
<p>She hadn’t eaten the previous night but that didn’t make her weak. Poverty crushed her and her mind was in ruins.</p> 
<p>Dust rose from the floor and rolled up on the light that lit the room. Her mind shifted and drifted. She shook her head; disappointment planted on her face. She found herself counting the holes again. 18 holes she counted this time. A minute passed gain.</p> 
On her consciously unconscious mind, she got up and heard retreating footsteps- like a high-heeled lady walking down a staircase. As was her habit, she scanned her room. A burning sensation run through her heart and she felt hatred and rage. She despised herself for how all had been. With her eyes stuck on one photo on the wall, and the only photo her cracked wall, a reflection of a white paper slipped under her door. She ignored it, her mind fully into the photo. 
It was a photo of her last day at the university. The graduation regalia had suited her so splendidly. As long as she could remember, it was the last day she smiled genuinely, and that was two years ago. She walked a step closer to the photo, even though it was already as close as it could be. She observed and touched it with enthusiasm, with a feeling that touched her heart; a reminiscence of good old days but that faded just as quickly as it came. 
Her mind still far away from the white paper that patiently waited on the floor, she walked back to her bed and threw herself and clamped her hands like she previously did. She took a deep breath and then rolled her eyes on her room again. The same old feeling crept in. Hatred. Rage. Death. 
She recalled the last time her mother wrote to her. The last time a member of her family wrote to her was more than a year ago, when her mother informed her that her younger sister had given birth and that the chief area had given them a notice of evacuation after claims that they were living as squatters. A letter that was heartbreaking. Shew couldn’t write back, not because she didn’t want to but because she couldn’t, the idea of expressing herself broke her. She was certain the letter wasn’t from her mother. Besides, she didn’t know where she lived. 
But there was one girl she sure knew her address, Karen Vaita Nambi.<br> 
Karen was her best friend. They graduated together. Karen had paid her a visit and had promised to send her something, which in her perspective meant anything, letter included. She had asked Karen to find her somewhere to stay. 
Misfortune, however, had befallen Karen. The cards of love gave her too many blessings with one Australian which later abandoned her, leaving her in grave situation. No job, no money, only three white kids to remember the Australian. She was going through a lot and sure did not have time to sit and write a letter. 
Lying on her bed, she nodded rhythmically to the music she created in her mind. After a few minutes, she rose and made her steps to the door, to the letter. A cold chill run through her body, making her nervous and trembling.  Her heart beat increased and suddenly she felt nothing, but that faded quickly. Below her belly ached and she groaned, a curving sensation of something being poked by a fork. She picked the paper. It read;<br>
Dear Sofia, I hate to say this to you but I don’t have any other way to express it. I don’t like to see you in distress, crushed down by poverty, something I can help you eradicate. You are a graduate from one of the best universities in the country. I bet there is no doubt that you were among the best of your year.
I have been watching you for a while. I know many things about you; some private things others not so much. Like the situation with your mum and Karen.
I am one of those girls you see along Peter’s Street at night and sometimes during the day with the cards on our necks. I didn’t choose that life. I think the one who said life always gives us choices didn’t consider my case. Anyway, I’d like you to join us. Join our family and life will be easier.  See you soon.<br> 
       Yours unknowingly,<br>
              Hope.<br>
      <br>
<br>The letter obliterated her even more. She despised the girl who saw an opportunity in her affliction. She put the letter under her pillow, picked her grey jacket and walked off towards Peter’s Street- towards the chapel. 
Peter’s street was unlike any other street. It was one of the largest streets and most crowded with girls who were in business. They were easily distinguishable because they all had the grey card. 
Sofia walked down the street as she usually did. Her hoodie on and her gait lingered between confidence and fear. A familiar neighborhood. On both sides, young girls who supposedly saw life as meaningless, were half-dressed, trying had to win over passing male. And because it was business, and every business has competition, there were others who were just a clothe from being naked, but nothing mattered to them because when the day ended, they’d be having some cash. Nothing mattered because they thought life never matters. 
With her hands tacked inside her pockets, she saw a small girl, probably 14, she had the grey card on her neck and her dress wasn’t fascinating. She might be new in the game, she thought. Suddenly under her belly ached again. She bent to get some air; she grunted with despair. Her eyes rolled and turned red and disappointment registered clearly on her face. ‘Everything hurts,’ she said to herself. 
There were other people along Peter’s Street and since there was a chapel just blocks away, it was hard to tell who was going where. Clergy men walked alongside prostitutes and nobody knew because nobody was bothered to ask. Peter’s Street- a strangely uniting street. 
Sofia walked towards the chapel, her mind constantly on the letter, ‘what was she thinking,’ she muttered to herself.
The chapel was on a three-storey building. On the left of the building entrance stood a statue of an asterisk shape that was mounted on top of what appeared as appeared as a big casket. The previous residents really did make a mess. Even the fitted tiles from the building entrance were patched, some clearly hit by a hammer. 
She entered the building compound and stood Infront of it, she stared blankly at the third floor. She matched forward. 
It was long since she entered the chapel. She had once sworn not to ever again walk the aisle of the chapel- the aisles of hope and faith. She considered it an obliteration of the soul but that did not matter because life taught her nothing but pain and suffering. 
Sofia walked the stairs of the building. She shivered and shuddered, her teeth racked as though she was feeling cold. Her heart raced and again she shuddered, ‘what’s happening to me?’ she asked herself. And suddenly, her fear disappeared, replaced fannishly and boldly by strength. She felt a sigh of relief.  For a short time. Thew same old feeling engraved her again. For a moment, she was happy but that faded and vanished quickly like spirit poured on a hot iron sheet. 
Unknowingly, she had walked the staircase to the chapel and was standing at the entrance to the chapel- a silhouette. Something then tagged her in the mind- the letter from Hope. She dismissed it.
Still standing at the entrance, she scanned a little more at the room. There were 14 people, she counted. The priest was calmly and clergy stating the vocals. ‘I have never liked the clerics,’ she murmured to herself. 
To avoid the awkwardness, she slowly walked inside and sat on the far left at the corner. She could feel something going on but could not make out what it was precisely. All of their backs, except the priest’s, were turned to her. Slowly, she followed what the crowd was doing; she knelt when they knelt, clapped when they clapped and murmured when they sang. The priest continued to the desk on the alter and picked his Bible. On top of it were four different crosses; one made from wood, another one from copper and the remaining two were of shiny silver….
A few minutes passed. The service was on going. From her corner, she saw everything. In front of her, there were three guys and right in front of them were six others more. One amidst them wore a black rain coat that stretched all down to his heels. He kept fidgeting but his neighbors didn’t notice or maybe they did not bother. The priest kept on, and they followed, except for him…
Sofia noticed how frequently he kept pushing something to fit under his armpit. She kept a keen interest at the man; she moved a bench closer to him, to the bench behind him. She sat on a slanted angle from him. She was consumed that she was missing what the priest was preaching but that did not matter because she was never going to get them anyway.
The guy once again tucked his left hand into his right armpit to adjust whatever it was. Something however, failed him; below his coat under her armpit was torn and something peeked out- a handle, staffed with black bladder and tied strongly to a metal like blade. Sofia thought and figured maybe it was a machete. Keenly, she noticed that the blade run down to his knees. It was a sword. Why would someone carry a sword to a church? He had a mission. 
Sofia took a heavy breath. Fear grasped her and small drops of sweat formed on her forehead. She took another breath to make her feel easy. She dragged her foot on the floor purposely. The guy with the sword turned his head to face her and their eyes met. Red spotted eyes. She saw rage and fear as though something was compelling him to do whatever it was that he was about to do.  He turned his head back and once again tucked under his armpit.
The service was almost over. The priest had lit a red candle and was about to ask guys who needed a prayer, the young man moved a bench closer to the alter. 
‘If you have any prayer request, come over,’ the priest’s voice echoed faintly in the room. 
The anxious man advanced another step closer to the alter. He did not kneel. He turned and looked at everyone in pity. His face showed like he was regretting his undid actions. A few people had gathered near the alter to be prayed for. Sofia sat silently on her bench; eyes stuck on the young fellow. 
Finally, he advanced to the priest. He dipped his left hand into his pocket and fished out something tied in a rubber. The priest stretched his hands out to reach it. 
‘what’s this?’ the priest asked, as he handed over a white candle to a young boy who’d knelt in front of him. 
The young man did not respond. He signaled him to untie it. 
The crowd had long dispersed but a few still waited in the benches. Sofia stayed. 
Still untying it, the priest turned his back to find something to cut it.
‘What is this?’ he asked again.<br>
‘I was told not to open it, that only you should open it,’ he said.
‘Well. It’s not coming off,’<br>
      <br>
The young man reached to his armpit and got hold of the sword. He did not fish it yet. He hesitated. Sofia gasped and rubbed her face. Meanwhile, the priest still untied it. Immediately the young man fished out the white shiny blade and with fragile yet strong force, flew it in the air and cut the priests head off. 
Everyone in there screamed, but Sofias voice was the loudest. The man stood there motionless, sword in hand trickling with blood as the priests head rolled from the alter area. The man dropped the sword and dropped on his knees. You could clearly see how disturbed he was. Sofia reached across the alter to try to save the already dying cleric. There was no saving him… there was no saving him. 
Everyone crowed the young man, he was lying on the floor, his left cheek resting on the pool of blood that had covered the entire alter area and a few steps down. 
The message spread faster and in no minute, the police were there. Sofia stood, hands tacked on her back, resting perfectly on her well mounted hips. Someone trapped her from behind.<br> 
‘See what they do,’ the voice whispered. Sofia turned and it was a young girl, probably 27. She was very becoming. She giggled.<br> 
‘What?’ whispered Sofia.<br>
‘Don’t be freighted honey, I’m not going to hurt you. I am however going to help you and him,’ the girl said pointing at where the killer was. 
‘I don’t want your help.’<br>
<br>      
‘Oh, but you do,’ she said.<br> 
 <br>     
‘I don’t understand what’s going on here… and who are you,’ asked Sofia.<br>
‘Who I am doesn’t matter now, what matters is that I can help you... I am not asking, I am demanding.’<br> 
Sofia sighed. Death at the alter! And immediately her mind run to the letter but its idea was not dismissible anymore. The girl was still standing beside her. There eyes met amidst mistrust.<br> 
‘Let’s go get something,’ the girl said.<br>
‘I should trust you?’ asked Sofia.<br> 
‘No. You don’t have any reason to trust me. And I don’t have any reason to trust you but I think after seeing what happened, you should consider changing your mind.’ 
‘No,’ resisted Sofia.<br>
‘Come on Sofia,’ she said.<br>
Sofia looked at her with concern and anger and terror.<br>
‘How do you... how do you know my name?’<br>
‘I am Hope and we need to go now!’
