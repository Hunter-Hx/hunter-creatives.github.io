    <p>
      We walked down the road in silence. Mutinda wasn't taking to me. He was jealous that Wairimu chose me instead of him. But for how long were we gonna walk on a pin drop silence?</p>
'So what?' I started the conversation<br>
'You know,'<br>
'I didn't choose her, she chose me,'<br>
<p>Mutinda hated himself. He never wanted to be him. His face was the reason. He feared ladies too. How was I going to help my fellow? Nonetheless, I never lacked ideas. The only idea I lacked then was where we were going to survive.</p>
'I'll find you a girl,' I assured him. I could see his black folded face smile. He was somehow cute when he smiled. He was so easy to lure.<br>
<p>We were friends. Small stuffs like girls weren't going to ruin our friendship. We'd walked and now we were drained and tired. We had reached Nywari town; seven miles from our village.</p>
'Where to spend our night?' I was always the first to ask.<br>
'Let's go inside a club,'<br>
'You got any money?'<br>
'Yeah. I got some two hundred shilling from the old woman's bag.' Mutinda had stollen Dayo's money.<br>
<p>Two hundred wasn't enough to sustain us at the club. I felt some guilt but I couldn't do anything. We needed money. And even God knew. In life you must have funds.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, it was a promotion day. Entry fee was eighty shillings. That meant we were only left with forty bob.</p>
<p>Since it was my first time at a club. I didn't know what to do and what not do. Dance? Watch people dance? Dance alone or with a girl. I was certain that Mutinda too has never been to a club. But hey, we were there to do whatever guys were doing there.</p>
<p>I set my eyes on a lot of guys dancing. Young girls, young men, old women, old men... everyone minded their business. On the far conner of the entrance door were three huge ladies. Their table was filled with drinks. Walichafua meza... with the pounding loud music, you could only see their lips moving. One thing was for sure, those ladies had money. On the other end were other group of people. Not rich not poor; they were there; sharing whatever any sponsor would bring along. In the middle, was the dancing field ground. Everyone had their match. Swaying to the beats of the music. And then... there was us, no girl, no one to talk or dance with. Mutinda and I were stranded.
<p>First two hours went on smoothly. I was enjoying being there. Mutinda never ceases to forget.
'Hey you said you'll find me a girl,'<br>
'I know. Do you have any money left?'<br>
'What for?'<br>
      'These girls won't have you when you have no money.'<br>
'Ooh no, just bring me one. I'll try to fumble out...' Mutinda concluded.<br>
<p>I was figuring where to get him one girl. I wanted to find any girl since Mutinda didn't have any taste. He had longed for a girl that he was now desperate to have any. I walked amidst the crowd trying to find a girl. There was none.</p>
'Bro, girls are yet to arrive, relax I'm finding you something legit,' I told him. He smiled.</p>
<p>Poor Mutinda was smiling. Ooh I'll have a girl; I know he said.</p>
<p>Midnight was there already. I had to find the girl for it was freezingly cold. But the stench of people sweating had swallowed all the cold. I walked around once again; this time I found a lady; not old not young. She was there, after all she was female. That's all Mutinda wanted. Lucky for me, she was like Mutinda. A perfect match I'd say. It was her first time to be at the club. Her appearance really showed she'd never been to a club or even some makeshift club. She wore sweater and a tight-jeans. But with the sparkling club lights, it was not clear what color she wore. Her body was enormous and her upper body had swallowed her lower body making her unbalanced. I couldn't really tell the color of her skin. Her mountainous breast flopped over her chest dangling every time she moved and... that's all; her beauty was quite unique. I walked up to her. Briefly, her name was Norah. I said whatever had brought me to her; hey my friend over there is interested in you... those were the key words. Always hard to say but always speak directly what you want! She gave in. Mutinda found love.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as I was struggling for Mutinda, he had dozed off amidst the pounding club music.</p>
'Hey mate! Get up...'<br>
'Something good?'<br>
<p>The lady was surprised. Mutinda was so much confused. He didn't know when to speak or when not to but that didn't bother me whatsoever, he wanted a girl, I brought him a girl. Talking and seducing was up to him now.</p>
'I'll get back to you guys,' I said as I walked away. I had to find my own since Wairimu was miles away; million miles away, yet so near in my heart.<br>

<p>***</p>
<p>Within, the ladies who were next to the door were still rooted there. They didn't move. They did nothing; only talked shit. I was starting to feel some hunger. I always starved... Walking past them, one clutched my shirt. She was be the leader of the female park. I tensed. Did I walk to a restricted place? I asked myself way too many questions as I tried to remain calm and composed.</p>
'Want a drink?' one huge dragon asked.<br>
'Ummah... no I'm okey,' I said slugging.<br>
'You can't come here and not drink...'<br>
'I was just passing when...'<br>
'No,' one cut me short.<br>
