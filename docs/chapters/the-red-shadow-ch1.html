      Have you ever had that feeling of wanting to be someone else? Well, I experienced that in a way I never expected. You see, I was a typical church boy, just like most of us during our innocent childhood days. I had mastered all the gospel songs in our local language and knew a smattering of English. And when I say smattering, I mean I could barely string a few words together. But hey, I was the church boy, the holier-than-thou type.
    </p>
    <p>
Dreams of becoming a pastor always danced in my heart. Every day, I aimed perfection, trying to memorize a verse or two and grasp some meaning from it. Then came Sunday school, my chance to shine. The moment I would step up and present my newfound wisdom, I knew I would be rewarded with something beyond imaginations—okay, maybe just a few scattered claps, but to me, they felt like a five-factorial standing ovation. It was pure bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was good at that first phase. If there was ever a time I truly believe I could catch a glimpse of heaven, it was during those moments. I had my sight set on divine greatness, armed with my limited English vocabulary and an unwavering desire to be the holiest of the holy. Little did I know that my journey towards holiness would take an unexpected turn, with a twist that would leave even the angels scratching their heads...

They say time heals, but it pays no mind to man. It soars on its own wings, indifferent to your actions or inactions. It’s the ultimate game changer of our lives. I developed new interest; girls and watching crime-related stuffs. I was the top-notch guy within a short time. Oh, Pablo Escobar, the man with money making magic! Everyone liked him... Well, not the government, of course, but hey, I liked him. I’d spend hours watching his crime documentaries. I mean, who wouldn't be drawn to all that wealth?Cha-ching! But watching him didn't make me rich. I didn't find Escobar's secret stash while sitting on the couch. Richness don't diffuse through screens, you know? If only it were that easy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
Every time I was from church or anywhere, I’d spend some time to watch one documentary of Pablo. It just felt super cool. Watching a rich dead guy and imagined if the money was all mine. I was truly two in one; holier but diabolic. Can someone truly embody holiness while constantly surrounded by the deafening noise of crime?

    As we grow, our tastes evolve, and some disappear while others emerge within us. My motivation for attending church and school underwent a humorous transformation. Church became the place to catch a glimpse of enchanting Lavender, and school was where I could behold the captivating Jennifer. These two girls held absolute sway over my actions making me as fluid as water. Now, don't jump to conclusions; it wasn't ablutophobia, fear of bathing, that haunted me. Instead, I become a dedicated bather, hoping to impress these two queens with my impeccable cleanliness.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I played a cunning game at such a tender age! But, let's face it, was really a brilliant strategy when I couldn't decipher whether either of the girls liked me back? I was like a young Sherlock Holmes, analyzing every move I made with the hopes of winning their hearts. It was like trying to solve a mystery without any evidence! Monday to Fridays I could see Jennifer at school, which made her a bit more common figure than Lavender. But I still liked her. Not more than Lavender. No. I liked them equal. I liked them without telling them. I liked being with them. I felt whole by just sitting next to either. It was the form of love; I guess the only genuine love that ever existed. Love that had no expectations like today’s. Childhood love slaps.
