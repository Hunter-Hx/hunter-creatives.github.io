    <summary><strong>After Everything</strong></summary>
    <p>
      At night, when the tie is hung,<br>
      And the T-shirts lie scattered,<br>
      Socks on the floor,<br>
      The kitchen still warm with dinner.<br>

       When the wigs are removed,<br> 
       And the makeup is washed,<br>
      The shelf in disarray,<br>
      And the vest is on,<br>
      The TV is muted and the assignment is are done,<br>
      The kids half-asleep and the doors locked,<br>
      That's when 'love' happens-<br>
       Or whatever they call it.
    </p>

  <details class="poem">
    <summary><strong>Frozen Embrace</strong></summary>
    <p>
Wake up boy!<br>
Dig that grave<br>
And release your friends to the waiting angels,,<br>
Is not bad to be lonely, you see?,<br>
The world will not pamper you boy!<br>

Boy!  Take that shovel<br>
Mix that sand and gravel<br> 
And get messy in it,<br>
Question your flaws, critique with honesty<br> 
And if need be, surrender,<br>
The world is not your mom, boy!<br>

Boy! This is your toll,<br>
Sweat all day long,<br>
Endure hunger if provisions fail,<br>
Boy! Future is for you,<br>
You gotta be tough boy!<br>

Boy! Walk the streets,<br>
Cry and get eliminated,<br>
The World has no use for cry babies,<br>
Boy! Your tears better be viscous!

    <summary><strong>Unfinished Prayer</strong></summary>
    <p>
      I prayed with broken sentences,<br>
      faith stitched with doubt.<br>
      Heaven listened anyway.
    </p>

  <details class="poem">
    <summary><strong>Zoning Out</strong></summary>
      <p>
      I sit on public transport, <br>
      and sometimes I zone out. <br>
      Not because I'm tired, <br>
      It's just a fascinating dark place, <br>
      that I find hard to leave, <br>
      and hard to stay.
      </p>

<details class="poem">
 <summary><strong>Absolution</strong></summary>
    <p>
      I was not raised in absolution, <br>
      this doesn't guarantee me being good <br>
      or bad or something worse. <br>
      It's the serendipity, <br>
      that aligns from calamity.
