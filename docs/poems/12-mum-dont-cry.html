    <p>
      Mum, don't cry<br>
For the pain that we are going through<br>
We'll soon overcome this trial<br>
And lay these burdens to rest<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
It hurts me to see you cry<br>
And pains me to see your tears overflow<br>
But please mum, don't cry<br>
For the agony will soon wane.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
They labeled you a beggar<br>
Just because you wanted us to feel better<br>
But mum, don't cry<br>
My love for you remains true<br>
And my plans for you are nothing but good.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
I hate to see your tears<br>
For it clouds my happiness and dims my hope<br>
So please mum, don't cry.<br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
I feel your burden, mum<br>
And it hurts to see you alone<br>
But please mum, don't cry,<br>
For we hope for a brighter tomorrow<br>
Where the stars light our path<br>
And success is ours forevermore<br>
      So mum, don't cry.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
Liters of tears have overflowed<br>
And I will never tire of wiping them away<br>
Because you are my lovely mum<br>
Even in tears, I still love you<br>
But please mum, assure me you won't cry<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
Mum, don't cry<br>
For tomorrow will be better<br>
And we'll share bread and butter.<br>
    </p>
