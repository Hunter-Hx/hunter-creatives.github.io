    <p>
One day,<br>
I will rest six feet underground,<br>
As sand and earth lay atop my frame,<br>
Water will trickle over my remains,<br>
The Sun will shine on my grave,<br>
And heat will fill the air inside.<br><br>
    </p>

     <p> 
My body will decay and rot,<br>
Maggots and mites will feast,<br>
As my skeleton lies shattered,<br>
Scattered within my new home.<br><br>
     </p>
  
       
      <p>
Friends may forget me,<br>
Relatives may remember,<br>
But in the end, it matters not,<br>
For I will be gone, FOREVER.<br>
      </p>

    <p>
Why must we face this fate,<br>
To leave this world and disintegrate?<br>
Is there a purpose or a plan,<br>
To this end we all must understand?<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
But until that final day,<br>
I'll live my life in every way,<br>
And cherish all the moments spent,<br>
Before my body and soul are rent.
    </p>
